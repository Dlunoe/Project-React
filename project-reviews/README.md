###
This app is built and designed to be a basic app to hold game reviews. Users will be able to create accounts to add their personal reviews of videogames to a database.
The end goal is to have a styled app that will display reviews in the database with the user's review and number rating displayed under the title.

V2 plans include adding a review model and search function, so that all reviews for one game will be held under the name instead of creating duplicates. The search function will, as expected, allow someone to search for a specific game and see all of the reviews for that game on it's own page.
V2 plans (possibly sooner) will also add a clear user page to keep track of each users reviews across all games, and preventing them from leaving duplicate reviews (likely to redirect to an update page/modal.)
