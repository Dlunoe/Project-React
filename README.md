# React API Project

## Description
This app began as a review app, but evolved into what you see now. Using React, mongoose, and mongo features, I have developed a personal game diary. Every gamer has their favorite games, and will without a doubt play them more than once.
 Are you on your 27th Skyrim playthrough, and can't remember if you liked playing Two-handed? Are you rebooting the Mass Effect again, but can't remember if you like a certain someone enough to save them? This app should help keep track of those things, so you don't get halfway through a playthrough before you finally remember why you hated that character build. You know what I'm talking about.

## Language Information
This app uses an express server to hold your login info, and all information is entered by the user. Mongoose and express take care of the backend, while React displays all the relevant information on the browser, with reactstrap adding cleaner buttons and modals for the forms.
